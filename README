A toy web server written in zig.

I'm not very good at zig so the zig code is bad.

The idea is that instead of actually parsing requests, looking up files on disk, and formulating responses,
we iterate over the document root once, at startup, and create a hash table mapping requests to response,
and then whenever a request comes in we serve raw bytes straight out of the hashtable.
