 - load the web content from disk
 - support HTTP/1.0 (just add 2 entries to the hashtable, one for HTTP/1.0, one for HTTP/1.1)
 - support pipelined requests
 - profile
 - benchmark, compare to nginx
 - strip query strings (maybe? should profile it first)
 - instructions for deploying a static site with docker
