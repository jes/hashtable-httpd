 - recurse into subdirectories
 - check if insertion into a hashtable copies the key+value: if so, free the ones we created
 - get correct content-type
 - support HEAD requests
 - support pipelined requests
 - support Range queries
 - handle errors (instead of catch return etc.)
 - profile
 - benchmark, compare to nginx
 - strip query strings (maybe? should profile it first)
 - sensible logging
 - instructions for deploying a static site with docker
 - use memory more efficiently (instead of page_allocator)
 - use cpu more efficiently than making a separate thread for each client
